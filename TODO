TODO list for SeeBorg v1.0
--------------------------

in no particular order:
 - Implement rest of the PyBorg features
 - Any form of control over join invites behaviour
 - Better CTCP replies (it replies to everything with the same thing at the 
   moment)
 - Optimize (there's a lot of room for that, like, remove std::string)
 - Write documentation (man pages, win32 chm, so on)
 - Use SQLite for word databases.
