= SeeBorg readme file =
-----------------------
SeeBorg is a random phrase bot that will sit on IRC channel, learning the 
talk, and periodically replying with something that is generated from the talk 
learned before. It usually doesn't make much sense, but sometimes it's funny, 
and sometimes very hilarious.

There are some configuration options that will make you able to tweak some of 
the bot's behaviour. Also if you set yourself as an owner, you will get access 
to IRC trigger commands (those that begin with '!').

It can learn in any language, not just english, but for better character 
processing (like case conversion), you will need to set appropriately your 
system locale.

To compile, read the Makefiles and make any changes required (you may probably 
want to change CFCPU to better value), then type `make' and fix the errors 
which will be displayed, if any. SeeBorg is in development and probably won't 
work as you expect.

After running "make", you'll end up with two executables - "seeborg-irc" and 
"seeborg-linein", these are IRC client or linein interactive mode 
respectively. The linein is useful for offline chat with the bot and to test 
the modifications done to the dictionary.

Without any parameters, seeborg-irc reads configuration from "seeborg-irc.cfg" 
file located in current working directory. If it doesn't exist, it will create 
one and terminate, suggesting you to inspect the config file, that would be a 
good idea.

If you find this program entertaining, you might want to help me develop it. 
The TODO file contains a list of yet-to-be-done things/ideas.

                 (default: #test #seeborg)
magicwords     - Space separated magic word list to reply to according to
                 replymagic value, useful if bot has alternative nicknames,
                 like russian. (no default)

                 hostname will be locked after each bot restart. (no default)


== Portability ==
-----------------
It compiles succesfully with GCC v2.95.3, GCC v3.2, GCC v3.2.2 and MSVC v6.0. 
Tested succesfully on Linux 2.4.x, FreeBSD 4.6.2, mingw32 and Win32.

I see no reason why it shouldn't compile and run on any other platform that is 
supported by botnet library and supports standard C++.

If compiling under mingw32 and cygwin, you would want to uncomment LDFLAGS 
line (one with -lwsock32) in the Makefiles.
